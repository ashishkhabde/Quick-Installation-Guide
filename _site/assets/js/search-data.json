    "content": "Accessing ownCloud Files Using WebDAV You can connect and synchronize your files placed on ownCloud over WebDAV, as ownCloud supports the WebDAV protocol. Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) extension that makes it much easier to create, read, and edit files on Web Servers. With WebDAV you can access your ownCloud shares on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows in the same way as any remote network share, and stay synchronized. You may also connect your desktop PC to your ownCloud Server by using the WebDAV protocol instead of using another client application.",
